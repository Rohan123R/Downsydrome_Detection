# Downsydrome_Detection

This research aims to enhance the detection of Down
syndrome using a combination of automated image annotation,
object detection, and classification techniques. Ultrasound images
were annotated through a coded process to mark regions of
interest (ROIs) indicative of Down syndrome. Utilizing YOLOv8,
the system was trained to accurately identify these ROIs.
Subsequently, a pre-trained VGG network was fine-tuned with
a labeled dataset to classify the identified regions as either
indicative of Down syndrome or normal. The integrated method-
ology achieved high accuracy in both detection and classification
tasks, demonstrating significant potential for improving prenatal
diagnostic processes. The results underscore the effectiveness
of combining deep learning models for precise and reliable
detection of Down syndrome in ultrasound images. Based on these
results, tailored model selection recommendations are provided
for detecting Down syndrome in ultrasound images, considering
various computational capabilities.
